# Kicad File S-Expression Parser 

This is a set of scripts (part of my Circuit Compass project) that unravels clojures from
Kicad files. Kicad expression compilation is not implemented as it stands, I needed this for
something work related. 

## Working Demo: 
![The string](path "imgs/1.png")
![The grammar](path "imgs/2.png")
![The output](path "imgs/3.png")
![Output representation](path "imgs/4.png")
